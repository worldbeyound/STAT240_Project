## Introduction
What separates a super bowl winner from the rest? Are there any unique characteristics that are needed in order for a team to win the super bowl? In this analysis we seek to answer these questions by analyzing the super bowl winners and the rest of the NFL from the last 10 years. 
  How does offensive aggressiveness, defensive success in the red zone, third down conversion rate and touchdowns per game differ between the average superbowl winner and the rest of the NFL? What conclusions, if any, can we make about future Superbowl winners?
  These questions will guide our discussion and analysis accordingly. We predict for all variables there will be a statistical difference between the Superbowl champions and the NFL average in the last 10 years.
H0: mu = 0, there is no mean difference between Superbowl winners and the NFL
H1: mu â‰  0, there is a mean difference between Superbowl winners and the NFL.  

## Background

  We began the analysis by downloading the data from Github's "Awesome Public Datasets". NFL play-by-play data is accessed through r packages created specifically for analyzing NFL data [@R-nflfastR]. By installing the package "NFLfastr", then using the function "load_pbp" we were able to view the play-by-play data for the last 10 seasons (2012-2022). Led by Sebastian Carl, he and 10 others published NFLfastr in January 6, 2023. 
  This study focuses on four variables. The first Variable was constructed by first filtering when teams were backed up on their own 30 yard line. Then we divided the distance the ball travels in the air when thrown (air yards) by the distance the ball carrier runs with the ball (yards after catch) to get our offensive aggressiveness statistic, under pressure, per play. The higher the value indicating higher offensive aggressiveness. 
  Our first variable is air yards divided by yards after catch. This variable was constructed to represent the teams aggressiveness when they are backed up in their own 30 yard down. Air yards represents the distance the ball travels in the air to the target. Yards after catch represents the distance the player travels after receiving the catch. Air yards divided by yards after catch will represent the teams aggressiveness under pressure, this will be referred to more simply as the offensive aggressiveness stat.
  The second variable represents how good a team is defensively when the opposing offense is in the red zone (when a team crosses the 20 yard line) compared to the usual defensive success of the team. The Red Zone is the area within 20 yards of the end zone and therefore features the more important plays of every game. We chose the stat "Tackles for Loss" (TFL) as a good indicator for defensive success and divided both the superbowl winner's TFL and the average NFL's TFL in the Redzone by their TFL not in the red zone. Therefore, a higher number indicates that a team's defense is better in more important situations.
    The third and fourth variables represent average total touchdowns per game and third down conversion rate per game for Superbowl winners and the NFL. 

| Key Variables                                   | Description                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|         Air yards per yards after catch         | Represents team's aggressiveness |
| Tackles in red zone per tackles not in red zone | Represents team's defensive stat |
|             Third conversion rate               | Represents the teams ability to progress up the field closer to the touchdown |
|                Total touchdowns                 | Number of touchdowns made by team |


## Analysis

For each of our variables we graphed the Superbowl winners and the NFL. The first two give one point for each Superbowl winner and NFL per season. By connecting the points we were able to observe how Superbowl winners varied from the NFL averages. For our hypothesis to be true we would need a majority of the points to either be below or above the NFL average. The graphs for the third and fourth variables give a side by side representations of the NFL average and the Superbowl winners for the last 10 years. For these, we would expect the bars for the Superbowl winners to be higher than the NFL if our hypothesis is true. 

To test our hypothesis we chose to use a two sample t-test. This will give us a statistically supported conclusion of whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Specifically, the calculated p-value (p for probability) has to be less than .05 for us to reject the null hypothesis. We will also look at the 95 % confidence intervals for each variable to determine the range of values that represent all Superbowl winners.

Beginning with Air Yards and it's corresponding graph. The graph indicates some difference between the NFL and the Superbowl winners. We have Superbowl winners who have a higher offensive aggressiveness, but also, a couple who are starkly lower than the rest of the NFL. We can infer from this graph that Superbowl winners are unique in their play style. But is it significant? 

The mean of the Superbowl winners is slightly higher than the rest of the NFL. But, the p-value is not less than .05. Meaning, the mean difference is not statistically significant and we will not be able to reject the null hypothesis. The confidence interval allows us to predict that the next super bowl winner will likely have an offensive aggressiveness stat between 1.37 and 1.82. 

### Defensive Tackles For Loss

This second stat represents how good a team is defensively when the opposing offense is in the red zone compared to the usual defensive success of the team. The Red Zone is the area within 20 yards of the end zone and therefore features the more important plays of every game. We chose the stat "Tackles for Loss" (TFL) as a good indicator for defensive success and divided both the superbowl winner's TFL and the average NFL's TFL in the Redzone by their TFL not in the red zone. Therefore, a higher number indicates that a team's defense is better in more important situations.

```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
t.test(lev_dataset_2$dsrzonrzanfl)
t.test(lev_dataset_2$dsrzonrzsb)
t.test(x = lev_dataset_2$dsrzonrzanfl, y = lev_dataset_2$dsrzonrzsb)

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(temp3_2, aes(x = year, y = coefficient)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Category)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Category)) +

```


The graph depicts a difference between the Superbowl winners and the NFL average. Although, the points for the Superbowl winners aren't clustering on a particular side, which could mean no average difference.

As suggested in the graph, the means are quite close. The NFL having a proportion of 1.62 and the Superbowl winner 1.88. We fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically signifcant evidence that Superbowl winners have a different defensive success rate than the rest of the NFL (p = .91, two-sided). Still, we are 95% confident that the next superbowl winner will likely have a proportion for tackles for a loss in the Red Zone from .69 to 1.69. The relatively large range of values represented in the confidence interval represents the high variance we see in the graph.

This plot graphs the total touchdowns for each Superbowl winner and thre rest of the NFL over the past 10 years. 
 
The graphs show higher third down conversion rates for superbowl winners than the rest of the NFL. The p-value confirms our inference. We reject the null hypothesis that there is no mean difference in third down conversion rates between Superbowl winners and the NFL average
(p = .04, two sided t-test). In other words, Superbowl winners convert on third downs at a statistically significant higher rate than the NFL average. Additionally, we are 95% confident that the third-down conversion rate of past and future Superbowl winners is between .39 and .47.

Similar to third down conversion rate, visually, there is a difference in touchdowns per game for the Superbowl winner and the rest of the NFL. And, again, our p-value confirms what we see. We reject the null hypothesis that there is no mean difference in touchdowns between Superbowl winners and the NFL average (p = .03, two-sided). Superbowl winners score more touchdowns per game than the rest of the NFL. We are 95% confident that this number will be about 3 touchdowns. 


Since third down conversion rate and total touchdowns were both statistically siginificant. We thought it'd be interesting to find out if the two are related. With a correlation coefficient of .64, the two are positively related to some degree. In other words, an increase in third down conversions will also result in some increase in touchdowns.

## Discussion
Two out of the four variables show statistical significant differences in the Superbowl winner and the rest of the NFL, Third down conversion rate and touchdowns per game. Supported by t-tests, we were accurately able to infer a range of values for each variable in which the next Superbowl winner will take on. Super bowl winners convert third downs and score more per game than the rest of the NFL. Now this may seem obvious since by definition Superbowl winners are the best team in the NFL. But, our study turns this assumption into fact. Although NFL teams don't show a statistically significant difference in defensive success and offensive aggressiveness, there still is some difference. What separates a difference from a statistically significant difference is whether this difference can be assumed as a representation of all Superbowl winners. The reported positive correlation between third down conversions and touch downs is intuitive because the more third down conversions you have the closer you get to the endzone, the easier it is to score.


But we must consider some limitations of this study. Primarily, we only looked at four variables. There are hundreds of variables that could have been used for this analysis. Only analyzing four variables makes it rather difficult to make sweeping conclusions about superbowl winners. Additionally, some of the differences we found could be due to the difference in sample sizes. The rest of NFL is a larger sample representing all teams except for the Superbowl winner.

Nevertheless, the present study offers at least some insight into the disparity between Superbowl winners and the rest of the NFL. A case could be made that all Superbowl winners excel offensively while only some excel defensively. But, at the very least, we can say that, on average, when Superbowl winners complete more third-down conversions, they will score more touchdowns.

The logical next step would be to conduct a large study with the several hundred variables possible with this data set. Then, metanalytically, decipher what specific attributes are vital in winning a Superbowl and what doesn't matter. An alternate route could conduct confidence intervals for various variables use the values to make a statistically supported guess on who the next Superbowl will be.
